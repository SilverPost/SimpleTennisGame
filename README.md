# SimpleTennisGame

**SimpleTennisGame** is a tennis game with CPU.

The player moves the bar at the left end of the screen up and down to hit the ball. And the CPU also moves the bar at the right end to hit it.
If the ball arrives at your side, if you can not return it, the opponent gains 1 point. Those who earn 3 points earn will win.

# How to play

Click the **START** button to play the game.

Move the mouse up and the your bar moves up, move it down to move down.
When the ball touches the bar, it automatically hits you back, so there is no need to do any special operation for that.

If either one gets 3 points and the game ends, click the **RESTART** button to start the next game.
